# Django_React_Todo's List

A todo's list in react using axios and django for the bd. Deployed in Heroku

### Getting Started

Project was done in vscode so gitpod may have different deployment Ex: This project isn't using a dockerfile

### Other Repository
When I had the project working locally, I figured creating a new repository rather than a branch called `deployment` (for instance). Terrible practice, however I plan to transfer the deployment app code to this reposity once it's stable. For the time being, this is the updated --> [REPO](https://github.com/geekwise-alfredo-diaz/django-react-heroku) - Currently Working in Here

## Deployment

After commiting all added files to this repo, I then run
```
git push heroku <branchname>
```

## Built With

* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Deployment used
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Backend
